Landlock LSM: unprivileged access control
=========================================

:Author: Mickaël Salaün

The goal of Landlock is to enable to restrict ambient rights (e.g.  global
filesystem access) for a set of processes.  Because Landlock is a stackable
LSM, it makes possible to create safe security sandboxes as new security layers
in addition to the existing system-wide access-controls. This kind of sandbox
is expected to help mitigate the security impact of bugs or
unexpected/malicious behaviors in user-space applications. Landlock empower any
process, including unprivileged ones, to securely restrict themselves.
